# First-python-project
This is my first python project ever.

Before this project I never had any interactions with the language, everything I did was a mixture of my C knowledge, a 75 minute video
about "everything you need to know about python in 75 min" and a video about how to save and read information from a txt file in python.

Of course this program doesn't have the best practices, but to be my first python program I think it's enough. I'll probably gonna keep on 
change in it until I feel is good.

But anyways, what is this program about? It's actually really really simple.
The first idea was doing a program about temperatures, it would let you insert, list, remove and modify temperatures, it would also let you
calculate the average.
All the information is stored in a .txt file called "information", and by information I mean the temperatures.
